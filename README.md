Tic-Tac-Toe - A next-gen version of the classic game of strategy and wit.
===

Two player Tic-Tac-Toe built in Javascript, JQuery, HTML, and CSS
---

### Gems & Libraries

*  Underscore.js
*  JQuery

### Getting Started

1.  Open index.html
2.  Find a friend
  *  Friend not required. Can be played solo, but it's much less fun that way.
  *  Chicken can be substituted for friend, as can frenemy. (I played and lost a game of tic-tac-toe to a chicken at an aquarium as a child. I still wonder how I lost, and what a chicken was doing at an aquarium.)

### Controls

*  Click on the square you want to play when it's your turn as indicated at the top of the screen
*  Let your partner click when it's not your turn

### Goals

This was a quick project to practice building things in Javascript, and to get familiar with Underscore and Jquery.

### Credits

Most of the game was written in collaboration with Sarah Quigley - github.com/sarahquigley.
